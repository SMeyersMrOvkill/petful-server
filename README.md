# Petful Server

A working version of this can be found here: https://petful-client-template-rho.vercel.app/

To use the app, first click the link above.

After you get to the page, it will show you the current state of pet adoption.

When you enter your name and click submit, you will be added to the list of people waiting to adopt a pet.

The users in front of you will make their decisions about whether they want to adopt the pet or not.

This is a tough choice, because you can only adopt the pet that has been in the shelter the longest. So they can take up to 5 seconds to make their decision.

When it's your turn, you will see the pets that are available for you to adopt. You can adopt a dog, a cat, or both.

When you finally reach the front of the line, people will start lining up behind you.
